# Number-guess-game

This is a number guessing game developed in python. It's a small attempt from my side.

About the game:
This is number guessing game between the user and the computer.
The computer comes up with a random number within a particular range and the user should guess the correct number within n number of attempts.
Here the number of attempts is 5. The computer also gives the user with clues while guessing the number such as whether the number is high or low from the actual number

NOTE : The game still has certain implementation to be done. This is Work in progress.
Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks!
